# Islandz

## Overview

Islandz was produced for the Terrain Programming Coursework in Third Year.  
I used OpenGL, and using examples from [Focus On 3D Terrain Programming by Trent Polack][1] created this tech demo that was supposed to include raising and lowering land in real time in the hopes of making a very basic Populous style clone.  
It didn&#8217;t quite work out that way, due to using the ROAM algorithm which generates a new mesh every frame, making it rather difficult to get the exact point to modify.

## Downloads

As stated above, this includes all media files and full source &#8211; with a codeblocks project file.  
The download is supplied with a Windows binary which you&#8217;ll need to run from bin/release/Islandz.exe or bin/debug/Islandz.exe for it to find it&#8217;s media files.  
Vista and XP SP2+ users &#8211; This asks to connect to the internet, it does NOT use the internet ( source is supplied so you can check ) it&#8217;s just the engine framework used has internet support, and I didn&#8217;t disable it.

## Project Status

It met the Coursework spec and goals, and got me a good grade, so it&#8217;s complete in that respect.  
I may go back to it at a later date, but probably stick to isometric 2D or re-do the terrain implementation so I can get the actual terrain co-ordinates.  
This was also the last coursework created in the old SGameZ framework before SGZEngine was started.
