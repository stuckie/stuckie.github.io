# Tiny Critters
![Logo](logo.png)

So, Tiny Critters was originally started in 2005 and released as part of a PS2Linux coursework using ncurses.
Which looked something like this:

![PS2Ingame](ps2ingame.png)

And was in effect a Chu Chu Rocket clone.

I did however like the idea of it, and little creatures running around, as well as a more grounded character within the world that you controlled much like Troddlers.
So, I then started doodling and came up with these three characters:

![Beastie](beastie.png)
![Wizard](wizard.png)

And drew some sprites as well:

![WizardSheet](wizardsheet1.png)
![XmasWizard](xmaswizard.png)

Made some music:

And put together a sprite test while working on my Honours project:

There were even some levels designed!

![Level2](level02.png)<br /><br />
![Level3](level03.png)<br /><br />

These were playable, there did exist a small 5 level playable demo....<br />
But it got lost in a hard drive crash, and that hurt a bit as I was rather invested in this one.

So... over a decade later, I've started looking into it again as an Arcade Badgers game.

This has been restarted a number of times, so hopefully, this time, we can get it out!
