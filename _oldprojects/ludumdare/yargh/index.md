## Project Progress

This was created as an entry for Ludum Dare.  
It is the last project to have used SGZEngine, and introduced smooth scrolling, mouse input, and masses of command-able units at once.  
This did show me that the engine was due for retirement however, as the mouse input is very laggy when there&#8217;s a lot on screen, and the tile painter isn&#8217;t the smartest of code either.  
Yargh! is, unfortunately, unfinished.. however it does provide a base for building upon at a later date.

## Major Points To Consider

The screen resolution was designed for PC use this time, hence it mostly running in 1024&#215;768 and the large screen shots above.  
A Mouse is also required to play.

## Future Work

With SGZEngine being retired, and no current engine taking it&#8217;s place, most of the SGZEngine projects are on hold till something comes up.  
However, Yargh! is somewhat unique in that it essentially completely bypasses the C-Engine and performs nearly everything Lua-side, making it one of the more easier games to port when a new engine is written.
