# Black Squirrel

## Overview

The Arcane Badgers have descended upon the forest and locked up all the Squirrels! Only one managed to evade capture &#8211; The Black Squirrel &#8211; who must now fight his way through the forrest to save his friends, and teach the Badger King a lesson!

## Project Progress

Short of some level drawings, the above concept art, and a couple of music tests [including a title track](https://soundcloud.com/steven-campbell-628493895/black-squirrel-title); nothing much came about of Black Squirrel.

It was meant to be a side-scrolling platformer, much akin to Ninja Gaiden on the SEGA Master System crossed with the big colourful sprites and worlds of Sonic.

I might return to it at a later date, however.
