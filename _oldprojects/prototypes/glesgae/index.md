GLESGAE was an engine I started specifically to learn OpenGL ES, OpenGLSL ES and to fiddle with Android and component systems.
It didn't really get anywhere much, but the full source can be [found on GitHub](http://github.com/stuckie/glesgae) if you're curious.

When Arcade Badgers started, the plan was to build on it into the main engine for it's commercial endevours, and another project was started alongside it; JESSIE.
This was when it was rewritten from C++ to straight C.

I haven't touched it in a while. It compiled last time I looked though!
