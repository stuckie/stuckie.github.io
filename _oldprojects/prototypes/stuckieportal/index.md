stuckiePORTAL was a Portal front-end for SMF.  
It added page support, block support, and tied in to SMF&#8217;s member system for permissions and things, borrowing heavily from how YaPP was setup.

It was moderately successful and powered a few sites, and potentially still does.

The successor to this was siteENGiNE.
