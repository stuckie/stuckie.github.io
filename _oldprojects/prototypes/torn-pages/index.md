Torn Pages was started in 2006.  
It was conceived as an engine specific for adventure and role-playing games, ranging from Interactive Fiction to Â First-Person RPGs ala Dungeon Master, via the use of a verb system to be played on hand held consoles specifically.

It is currently on hiatus, as it is more a framework add-on rather than an engine in it&#8217;s on right, and the current engine is not in a usable state for it yet.
