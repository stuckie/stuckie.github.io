So&#8230; WordPress, eh?

Think I&#8217;ll finally actually pull everything together rather than spread out bits and pieces across three domains.  
Therefore, stuckieworld.co.uk, stuckieworld.net and stuckiegamez.co.uk will now all point here! Instead of random places.

Well, sortof.. they still have their own bits and pieces, but they&#8217;ll redirect here at any rate.

If you&#8217;ve found this before I&#8217;ve pushed everything over.. go, you! Now stop trawling through my server!

Hopefully, I can get the Project tree over without too much hackery to the theme.. I did have custom blocks per page in siteENGiNE which were pretty useful for only displaying the menu for the areas you were in.  
However, if I only get one large menu, it&#8217;ll atleast give me a kicking as to just how many random projects I have sitting about unloved!

Right.. it&#8217;s way past midnight now, and I wasn&#8217;t going to look at this till after I woke up.

Five Minute Install, maybe&#8230; hour to get the permissions setup afterwards, though!

And some code to match the Hello World&#8230;

<pre>#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
int main ( void )
{
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    return 0;
}</pre>
