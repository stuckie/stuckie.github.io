Perhaps a bit quicker than expected.. as I&#8217;ve not pushed everything over yet, but this&#8217;ll at least give me some incentive to do it as people complain about things being broken and such like.

At any rate, welcome to the new stuckieGAMEZ website/blog/thing which&#8217;ll probably stay like this for the next five years or so!

I&#8217;m still rooting about for more source code and things on backup discs to push up.. along with design docs and so forth, but there&#8217;s a lot of it as I do have the usual programmer trait of equal parts OCD and ADHD &#8211; I can bury myself deep into a project and be particularly anal about how things function, as well as get bored easily and jump to other projects or start again! I call it Half-Arsed Compulsion Disorder and seems to fit me pretty well.

I still have to pull over the bits and pieces from the old blog too.. however, most of that can just be lost and forgotten &#8211; or archived into articles, guides and tutorials rather than re-posts. And of course, translate all the old project stuff from the previous site over.. but this is made somewhat easier in that I&#8217;m abusing the page system in WordPress just as much as I abused my own page system in siteENGiNE, and in the same manner, so most pages are just a copy/paste over for the most part.

Anyway, it&#8217;s midnight on a Saturday and I think my insomnia is about to let me sleep.. so with a new site front end in place, it&#8217;s time to see what chaos is left for me in the morning!
