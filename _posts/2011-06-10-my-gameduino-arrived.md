Yesterday morning, I got my Gameduino in the post. Not bad considering it was shipped on the 31st May from over in California.

I won&#8217;t be able to have a good look into it for a few days to a week yet, but I did boot it up and have a fiddle with the pre-loaded Asteroids game, which led me to the conclusion that this thing&#8217;s going to be fun to play with! Looks pretty much like a nice little 8bit console type thing, and looking forward to doing a nice little game for it.  
So, I&#8217;m adding it onto The Quest.

Speaking of which, I haven&#8217;t had much time to fiddle with Core 24 on the Pandora. Nor fiddle with my engine in general.  
Work stuff has been progressing&#8230; nicely, I&#8217;d say&#8230; but it&#8217;s been eating up a lot of time, as it&#8217;s rather critical to get things right first time &#8211; or at least before anyone actually starts using it properly. So lots of extra work and thinking to ensure it all gels together properly.

I&#8217;m also currently collecting development environments for my hardware at the moment, anyway.. the older and newer machines are relatively easy to get compilers for, but it&#8217;s some of the ones in the middle &#8211; Dreamcast and Saturn in particular &#8211; which are a bit painful to find. I have messed with KalistOS before for the Dreamcast, so I&#8217;ll probably use that again&#8230; assuming I can find it. I also haven&#8217;t seen the Playstation compiler I used for quite a while either, and I imagine that&#8217;s going to be a right pain to find as well. At any rate, part of the reason for The Quest is to accumulate all these development bits and bobs in one place ( assuming they are pure homebrew and not leaked naughtiness of course! no badness here! ) so that I can remember where they are, if nothing else.

I&#8217;ve also still got some unfilled pages hanging around here that I&#8217;ve still to fix&#8230;  
Oh well.. they&#8217;ll all get done at some point <img src="http://stuckiegamez.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
