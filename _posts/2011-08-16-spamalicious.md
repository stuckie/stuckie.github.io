Well, it seems the spambots are barking at the door again&#8230; so I&#8217;ve upped the anti-spam stuff a bit.

I&#8217;ve also opened registrations, so that if you do genuinely want to post comments and things, you can register and not be annoyed by the anti-spam bits and bobs ( well, short of the one on the login form! )

Anyway, to fill out the post a bit, I&#8217;ve been working on GLESGAE recently, and finally pushed in a Resource Manager.  
Now I can care not about deleting things, as the system will do it for me, hurrah! Well, to a point&#8230; I still need to delete the groups and banks they sit in when I&#8217;m finished with them, but that&#8217;s the job of a State destructor &#8211; and the State System is next!

I&#8217;m somewhat aiming to attempt Ludum Dare this weekend.. we shall see on how much spare time I have nearer the end of the week. It&#8217;ll also be the testing grounds for GLESGAE in it&#8217;s current state, which&#8217;ll be fun as there&#8217;s still a fair bit to do on it, including but not limited to:

  1. State System
  2. Entities
  3. Memory Management
  4. Logging ( the few printfs that have sneaked in don&#8217;t count! <img src="http://stuckiegamez.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /> )
  5. Sound
  6. Windows Support ( this is probably rather needed as most people use Windows. I, however, am not most people <img src="http://stuckiegamez.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /> )

  There&#8217;s other things I want in GLESGAE but they&#8217;ll be done in due course.

  Right, back to work&#8230;
