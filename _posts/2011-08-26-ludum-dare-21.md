I took part in Ludum Dare 21 last weekend.

I didn&#8217;t get anything submitted in time due to reasons I&#8217;ve already gibbered about over on their blog: <http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2011/08/23/thieving-fingers-post-mortem/> but it was a good experience nevertheless.

It showed that my engine is in need of a lot of work, and that my highly prized \*cough\* resource manager that I had spammed about last time was as much use as a heap of molten slag.  
It&#8217;s far too basic.  
Now, that&#8217;s basic in the sense that it does very little to protect yourself from grabbing a chainsaw, and attempting to use it to trim your nails. It&#8217;s powerful, yes, but you&#8217;re likely going to lose a finger or two. And for heaven&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t sneeze!

So yes, engine needs more work, I think&#8230; the resource manager is probably fine as it is, it just needs some layering on top of it to make it less dangerous to use. I also need a hashed string implementation, rather than relying on unsigned ints everywhere, which become a total pain to manage.

However, 599 other people managed to submit something! That&#8217;s quite an achievement&#8230; and while I&#8217;m still slightly bitter about my laptop, in that I could&#8217;ve been number 600, I&#8217;m somewhat glad I didn&#8217;t get anything submitted in time, as there&#8217;d be no way I&#8217;d have much of a chance of rating much of that at all! And that would be bad to all the work people have put into them.

Doing games in 48-72 hours isn&#8217;t easy, but it&#8217;s really rewarding &#8211; you get so much freedom to do whatever you want that you just can&#8217;t get in a work environment. Ironically, it&#8217;s a good stress reliever for me, as after pounding at system bugs and platform issues for however long I have been, to be able to take a step back and chuck something together in a random weekend &#8220;FOR TEH LAWLS&#8221; is rather nice. And while I technically could do that every weekend, since when have I ever been that organized? <img src="http://stuckiegamez.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" />

Anyway, hopefully they do the same October challenge as they did last year, as I&#8217;d be keen to enter that&#8230; as well as the next Ludum Dare around December-time.

Perhaps I&#8217;ll even have an engine that isn&#8217;t full of bugs for once!
