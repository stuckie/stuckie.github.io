Well.. this hasn&#8217;t gone to plan.

I do have something on screen now!  
And I have Box2D Physics all bound up and active! ( Though I haven&#8217;t thoroughly tested it for the needs of the game, as yet. )  
But that&#8217;s about it!

Actually, I fixed a couple more engine bugs and abstracted some bits and pieces out to make them easier to deal with, so that&#8217;s good.. but still, progress overall has been rather minimal.

With only this weekend left, which has already been taken for something more important, there&#8217;s probably not much of a chance of Little Quirks getting out in time for the October Challenge.

So, what now?

I think that abandoning the Quirks ( again ) would be a bad choice.Â Some of the people I&#8217;ve talked to about it do think there&#8217;s something in it, and that&#8217;s always a good sign that gibbering about whatever game you&#8217;re working on sparks interest in those not affiliated with it, so it would be good to actually finish something that people might actually play.

But when will that happen?

That&#8217;s a trickier question&#8230; the remainder of this year is going to be pretty hectic for me, and finding time to work on anything outside standard work-related tasks could be particularly difficult. As this stuff doesn&#8217;t fall under the &#8220;standard work-related tasks&#8221; banner, it gets pushed to the side till free time comes available. So it&#8217;s \*cough\* done when it&#8217;s done.

The next few months are going to be mental compared to most of the year, so we&#8217;ll have to see what happens. I would like to have it done &#8211; or at least playable &#8211; by Christmas though.

That said, I have been known to randomly pull things out from nowhere, so we&#8217;ll see what happens on the run up to Tuesday.
