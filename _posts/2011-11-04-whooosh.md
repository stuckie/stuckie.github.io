I love that sound.

I hear it a lot as deadlines make that sound as they whizz past!

Yes, I didn&#8217;t finish Little Quirks in time for the October Challenge&#8230; actually, I managed less than I did during the original Mini LudumDare challenge.. go figure.

Also, going on from my little rant last time about working on Engines rather than the Game, I decided to eat said words, and have purchased a license for <a title="ImpactJS" href="http://www.impactjs.com" target="_blank">ImpactJS</a>Â which is a rather fancy and cleanly written Javascript Engine using HTML5 fanciness.  
I plan on using this pretty heavily soon, when my super secret secret project is set loose in a month&#8217;s time &#8211; which is part of the reason why Quirks didn&#8217;t get done in time. However, if the super secret secret project pans out well, Quirks will be done in Impact too, so it&#8217;ll all be good <img src="http://stuckiegamez.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />

Right, I&#8217;ve another whooosh sound to make&#8230;
