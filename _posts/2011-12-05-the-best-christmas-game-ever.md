As part of Atomicom I've helped push out "The Best Christmas Game Ever" which is a bit of a tongue-in-cheek adaptation of Switch with an overdose of Christmas goodness.

You've to guide Santa on his rocket powered sleigh through the snowy landscape, grabbing presents which the mischievous penguins have pinched and scattered around the place. You probably want to watch out for the trees and the penguins themselves, who'll be trying to stop you by ramming you atop giant ice cubes.
Grab as many presents as you can in the allotted time, and sing a long with Santa as he goes!

You can currently grab it on the Android market over here: <https://market.android.com/details?id=uk.co.atomicom.tbcge>
It's going for 99p and doesn't feature any ads to annoy you, either.

There's some more games brewing up over at Atomicom too.. so hopefully I'll remember to post about them when they go up!
