Well, 2011 was a bit of a turbulent year, but I managed to work quite a number of things.

Commercial: <br />
Commercially, I was relatively active, it seems!<br />
Bang Bang Racing : [Available for Tegra2 Android Devices][1] and Digital Reality are putting the finishing touches on the PS3 and X360 version which I also had a hand in.<br />
Switch! : [Ad supported Android Version][2], [Ad Free on Android][3] and [on iOS with an in-app purchase to remove the Ads][4]<br />
The Best Christmas Game Ever : [on Android][5] and [on iOS][6]<br />
Tiny Gems : [on iOS][7] with an Android version being wrapped up.

Ludum Dare:<br />
2011 wasn't a particularly great Ludum Dare year for me, as although I did make starts to every one of them, I didn't manage to finish any of them really! <br />
LD20's theme just didn't appeal to me at all, and I couldn't really think up of anything, and the same happened for the recent LD22; though I did start many ideas which may be expanded upon later.<br />
As for LD21, sneaky laptop issues stopped me from actually submitting it, but I did actually finish something on time - [Thieving Fingers][8].<br />
I also attempted to do the October Challenge, but failed miserably as the last quarter of the year caused a great upheaval of everything in my life, and lack of time and concentration destroyed any hopes of actually doing something, sadly. Though I did manage to get a grasp of HTML5 and JavaScript which developed further in LD22.

Pandora:<br />
When the Pandora finally got into my mitts, I was fairly active for it as I had a fair amount of time to devote to random fiddlings.. sadly as the year went on, my random fiddling time got cut shorter and shorter, so while I did start various projects such as [Extend Utils][9] and [Debian on SD][10], they've stagnated and have likely been superseded now by things that actually work!

Random Hackerings:<br />
I did have time to do the odd random hack, though.<br />
I gave Zear some help with a quick port of a Dingoo game over to the good 'ol GP32.. the process of setting up the [GP32 toolchain I documented on here][11].<br />
I also had a quick fiddle with the [Arduino][12] and [Gameduino][13] bits and pieces - though haven't actually released anything as yet, the same goes for the Jaguar Skunkboard I recently got from the [GOAT Store][14].

So, into 2012 now - what are my plans?<br />
Well, I will be doing the main Ludum Dare compos as usual ( this April's one should be a biggie! ) and Atomicom have a few new games coming up.<br />
I, myself, have a couple of projects in the works which shall hopefully start picking up steam soon, with one being targeted for the end of the month.<br />
As for random hackerings and picking up older projects, they'll depend on what free time I have left.

Should be fun!
