I&#8217;ve been mucking about with JavaScript to integrate it into my engine recently, and it&#8217;s been fun to mess with it at such a low level, and see the challanges that browser developers have to face in implementing the HTML5 spec. That said, I haven&#8217;t done a great deal of &#8220;pure&#8221; JavaScript yet, so that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m going to have to do at some point &#8211; yet another thing to add to the list!  
But what about the other popular language that derived from ECMAScript? Can I look at that instead and bolster on another language to my tool box?

The next seven days, I&#8217;ve set myself the challenge of doing something in ActionScript 3.0 ( well, six days now, as I spent the night looking about for various things, which I&#8217;ll be describing below. )  
There are reasons for this&#8230; both ActionScript and JavaScript are derived from ECMAScript, so should have a lot of common fundamentals, and both languages are very much used on the web. Learning more languages is always a good thing since as a Programmer, I will always try to use the right tool for the job and who knows when ActionScript will come in useful! Seeing how dominant it has been on the web, there&#8217;s always a possibilty of using it as the general shift to web-based apps continues. That, and being the madman I am, I always enjoy a good challange!  
The seven day deadline is also to ensure I actually finish something for a change, knowing how bad I am for doing that with my outside work projects!

I also have a special restriction &#8211; which is what I spent last night researching &#8211; in that I exclusively use Linux.

Back in first year University, one of my coursework projects was to create a game in ActionScript with Flash MX 2004. The resulting mess can be seen here: [Santa&#8217;s Elves][1]. Of course, I got to use the University computers to do this, and Flash is a rather expensive Windows/Mac only program anyway&#8230; so what can I do on Linux?  
I can use whatever text editor I like, and I can use [Adobe&#8217;s Flex SDK][2] ( which&#8217;ll soon be Apache Flex, as it&#8217;s currently in the incubator project ) to compile it into a Flash application. Luckily, Flash on Linux has been reasonably decent for a while now, so I shouldn&#8217;t have any problems viewing whatever I create.

So, what will I be up to the next seven days?  
Well, I have to get the toolchain setup, and do some quick tests to ensure things work.  
I then need to do some more advanced tests with graphics and sounds, and see how I can compile all of this into the Flash application; followed by reading files, writing files, etc.. the standard things you do when learning a new language. Then I can actually start on something.  
I effectively have a few hours per day to work on this after I finish my usual work, and while two little whirlwinds calm down, get fed, and go to bed&#8230; so I reckon I&#8217;ll have about 24 hours in total to work on it. Seeing as I&#8217;ve managed to write games for LudumDare in 48 hours from near enough scratch, this should be doable!

I&#8217;ll be posting each day with what I&#8217;ve got done, as a nice little breadcrumb trail should I end up doing ActionScript on Linux again &#8211; hence the tagging on The Quest.
