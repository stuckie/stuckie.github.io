Well, making a good start! \*cough\* <br />
I've somehow managed to muck my shoulder quite badly, so that's it's quite painful to do anything much&#8230; but I'll batter through it anyway.

Last night I cleaned my PC up a fair bit, and re-installed Ubuntu. I had been using Gentoo for a while, but it was starting to get a tad annoying to update things again, so I've put Ubuntu Studio on instead. <br />
I then got the toolchain up and running and built a few Hello World style things. <br />
Nothing complex yet, and if I feel up to it tonight, I'll be mucking about with Sprites some more.
