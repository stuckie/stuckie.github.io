Well, making a good start! \*cough\*  
I&#8217;ve somehow managed to muck my shoulder quite badly, so that&#8217;s it&#8217;s quite painful to do anything much&#8230; but I&#8217;ll batter through it anyway.

Last night I cleaned my PC up a fair bit, and re-installed Ubuntu. I had been using Gentoo for a while, but it was starting to get a tad annoying to update things again, so I&#8217;ve put Ubuntu Studio on instead.  
I then got the toolchain up and running and built a few Hello World style things.  
Nothing complex yet, and if I feel up to it tonight, I&#8217;ll be mucking about with Sprites some more.
