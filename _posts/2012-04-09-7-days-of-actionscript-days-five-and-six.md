Day Five was not wholly productive as I found out I had managed to download the 4.1 version of the Flex SDK&#8230; they&#8217;re up at version 4.6, which added, amongst other things, &#8220;native&#8221; JSON support.  
That was clever of me.  
So the few hours I had were spent banging my head against the wall, wondering why stuff wasn&#8217;t working, then spending the rest of it downloading the \_correct\_ SDK. I did at least get some working file utils going, so wasn&#8217;t completely wasteful.

Luckily, Day Six has been very productive and I now have my example up and running.  
It&#8217;s a little Sudoku game. Why? Because Sudoku itself is a relatively straight-forward game with some nice little mathematical fun to it &#8211; especially when figuring out a decent solver.  
All you need to do is fill a grid with numbers from 1 to 9, and ensure each block has unique numbers, along with each row and column.  
Granted, my solver just brute forces it at the moment, but I&#8217;ll take simplicity over complexity any day&#8230; that and I&#8217;ve still got to try and make it look pretty, as all it&#8217;s doing is reading an array from a file, fiddling with it, and spitting it back out to another file. Not really game material, eh?

So, tomorrow is effectively my last day on this&#8230; and I&#8217;ve still to figure out input, displaying graphics, proper event management, playing sounds&#8230; at least my shoulder has healed up a bit, and I can work a bit later into the night again.
