Day Five was not wholly productive as I found out I had managed to download the 4.1 version of the Flex SDK - they're up at version 4.6, which added, amongst other things, "native" JSON support.
That was clever of me. 
So the few hours I had were spent banging my head against the wall, wondering why stuff wasn't working, then spending the rest of it downloading the \_correct\_ SDK. I did at least get some working file utils going, so wasn't completely wasteful.

Luckily, Day Six has been very productive and I now have my example up and running. <br />
It's a little Sudoku game. Why? Because Sudoku itself is a relatively straight-forward game with some nice little mathematical fun to it - especially when figuring out a decent solver. <br />
All you need to do is fill a grid with numbers from 1 to 9, and ensure each block has unique numbers, along with each row and column. <br />
Granted, my solver just brute forces it at the moment, but I'll take simplicity over complexity any day - that and I've still got to try and make it look pretty, as all it's doing is reading an array from a file, fiddling with it, and spitting it back out to another file. Not really game material, eh?

So, tomorrow is effectively my last day on this - and I've still to figure out input, displaying graphics, proper event management, playing sounds - at least my shoulder has healed up a bit, and I can work a bit later into the night again.
