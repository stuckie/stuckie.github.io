Hmm, it&#8217;s been a while since I finished the 7 Days of ActionScript challenge I did, and I forgot to upload my source!

It&#8217;s now available [here][1].  
You&#8217;ll find the source itself, scattered amongst various .as files, a compiled SWF and a test puzzle which you&#8217;ll need to download to feed it. You can create your own if you like, as it&#8217;s just a JSON array of numbers.

Actual ActionScript programmers will likely recoil in horror at the code in there, but remember it was a crash course in ActionScript in seven days! That, and I was doing it on Linux as well, with Flex and gEdit rather than any of the more comprehensive IDEs available for Windows. Still managed to make a somewhat workable Sudoku game though.

Either way, that&#8217;s the end of that <img src="http://stuckiegamez.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  
Now for something completely different&#8230;
