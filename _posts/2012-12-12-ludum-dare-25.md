So I, along with my wife, will be entering this weekend&#8217;s Ludum Dare Jam.

This is scary.  
I haven&#8217;t done any programming since I had to leave Atomicom due to ill health &#8211; which had been up and down all year with the breaking point being in August.  
If things go particularly pear shaped, then it&#8217;ll likely crush my confidence and I&#8217;ll have to have a sit down and think whether I&#8217;ll be able to work as a programmer again.

But, this is also exciting.  
We&#8217;ll be working together on something we both love.  
And, if it does goes well, it&#8217;ll also set the grounding for myself getting better, as it&#8217;ll boost my confidence.

Bit of a double edged sword really&#8230; as it can go either way, but without risk there is no reward.  
I am at least being somewhat sensible about this, in using Impact as an engine, and JavaScript as a language. While it&#8217;s not my usual go to, what with being out of the world of programming for a while, it&#8217;s perhaps the safest option for now! OpenGL, SDL, C++ et al aren&#8217;t the friendliest of things to deal with after a long break from using them <img src="http://stuckiegamez.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

Additionally, we&#8217;ll be working together under the banner of Arcade Badgers.  
This has been a little sideline thing I&#8217;ve been planning for a while, and if this weekend does go well, it may well give me the kicking I need to actually go forward with it &#8211; and seeing as I&#8217;ll be stuck on benefits for the foreseeable future, I&#8217;ve not got anything to lose in trying&#8230; especially as there are Test Trading and Permitted Work clauses I can poke at.

Now to do some tests&#8230; what&#8217;s a variable, again?
