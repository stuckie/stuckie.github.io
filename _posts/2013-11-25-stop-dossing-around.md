For the past week, my server seems to be getting dos&#8217;d for some reason.

It&#8217;s quite annoying, please quit it.

Also, on the work front, not much has happened other than a major shake-up with GLESGAE being rewritten in C, and adding SDL2 support.  
Yargh! hasn&#8217;t actually been started yet ( on the code front, anyway. )  
This is due to currently being decanted from our house, while things are repaired&#8230; it&#8217;s been an interesting experience!

I also had a telephone interview with eeGeo, which was fun. Not sure how much my anxiety came through with me gibbering a bit, though.  
They had given me a programming challenge to do beforehand, which although I managed to make a bit of a mess of it due to current circumstances, I got pushed through to the telephone interview stage anyway. I do enjoy a good programming challenge, as I feel it&#8217;s a bit more constructive in seeing how someone can actually write code, and how they plan things out. I much prefer them to the SURPRISE! here&#8217;s a three page quiz for you to do at the interview, enjoy! thing I remember getting a couple of times after I just graduated. That&#8217;s just textbook regurgitation. That said, I was still given a few technical questions during the phone interview, and I stumbled about a bit from being a tad rusty.

Hopefully we get back in our house soon, and back to normality.

I need to work! And earn the pennies!
