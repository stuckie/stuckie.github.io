The past year has not been kind.

The losing of pets and family, school incidents, car damage, and fights with the council for new housing have quite drastically taken their toll to the point that this Christmas just hasn&#8217;t had that Christmassy feeling to it at all.

Business-wise, it wasn&#8217;t too bad&#8230; the Badgers finished a two-part contract that helped pay for a devkit&#8230; and to reimburse myself with the credit put in to the business to help pay for my Mum&#8230;  
We also released Grim!  
Not that it did very well, but small starts and all that.  
Incidentally, Grim is now free, so if you haven&#8217;t got it yet, go grab it from <a title="itch.io" href="http://arcadebadgers.itch.io/grim" target="_blank">itch</a> or <a title="desura" href="http://www.desura.com/games/grim1" target="_blank">desura</a>.

I&#8217;m also somehow still employed at YoYo Games &#8211; even with the being in-and-out of the office most of the year to deal with the various disasters and incidents that have unfolded. I have nothing but thanks and respect for them in allowing me to deal with everything. I do, of course, make up the time lost by working from home any way I can&#8230; it&#8217;s only right, after all.

Thankfully there is but one more day before 2015 arrives.

What will 2015 bring?

New EU VAT laws for certain.. which has put a hold on my plans to sell directly from the Badgers&#8217; site and build up a community. That wasn&#8217;t expected. It&#8217;s also the reason why Grim is now free, as I just can&#8217;t be bothered to deal with it all just now. I&#8217;ve more important things on my mind, than scouring for new VAT compliance measures. However, it looks like the standard of going through a well established portal is going to be the best option.

Hopefully another game or two from the Badgers.  
Don&#8217;t know what the next one will be at the moment, as the choice is amongst four.. but I&#8217;m planning on doing some tests in January to see what comes out best.  
One game I absolutely must do, is the remake/sequel of Germies. My Mum played that a lot, and still sits on the top of one of the leaderboards. I can&#8217;t not dedicate the next version to her memory. It would feel wrong. I also need to get it on the Wii U somehow, as she would have loved that.

Hopefully a new house as well.  
Currently we feel very cramped in our pokey little flat. While the council are adamant that &#8220;Children under 10 can share the same room&#8221; .. we&#8217;d like them to think about the horrors we&#8217;ve gone through that we&#8217;ve had to give them their separate rooms, and squish our bed into the living room. It seems to fall on deaf ears though, so will just have to start siphoning off a deposit from the wages. Might take all year to build one up, but that&#8217;ll just have to do.

And finally, better health.  
I&#8217;ve had enough with illnesses and things this year.  
I&#8217;d like to wish better health for everyone.
