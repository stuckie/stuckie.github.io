# About stuckieGAMEZ

The website, stuckieGAMEZ, is essentially a portfolio and backup site for Steven Campbell.  
It contains various projects that he has worked on; ranging from stand-out projects such as Plight of The Weedunks, to a lot of random crap.  
He figures that by at least storing and holding the crap on his own site and domain, he has some semblance of control over it&#8230; obviously not quite understanding the whole nature of once it&#8217;s online, the signal cannot be stopped!

Steven uses the stuckieGAMEZ moniker when releasing homebrew and opensource projects.

# About Steven Campbell

Steven Campbell, also known around the internet as some form of &#8220;Stuckie,&#8221; is a Programmer by trade.

He is mostly self-taught; starting from humble beginnings on a ZX Spectrum, progressing to the Atari ST and finally landing on the PC.  
However, being the gadget tinkering freak that he is, he can&#8217;t leave things well alone and branches out to development on a number of consoles, computers and hand held devices; ranging from Android, iOS, GP32, PSP, Dreamcast, Jaguar, Pandora, and generally whatever he can get his grubby mitts on.

Qualification-wise, he has a BSc with Honours in Computer Games Technology from the University of Abertay-Dundee.

Steven is currently employed in the Games Industry, and seems to like talking about himself in third person.
