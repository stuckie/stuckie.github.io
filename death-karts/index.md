# Death Karts

## Background

Back in 2001, I think, I was in an IT club at a local community centre. We were quite bored and we needed a project to do to save us from being shut down. For reasons I still don&#8217;t quite know, I decided &#8220;Let&#8217;s make a game!&#8221;.  
Now, I hadn&#8217;t really touched programming since STOS on the Atari ST, and had only been recently messing around with DIV Games Studio at that time, but thought I could easily pick it up as I went. This sortof worked, and we did produce a game of sorts, but we didn&#8217;t really have much time to put into it ( about a week if I remember correctly ) so everything is very rushed, and there&#8217;s no physics to speak of!  
I don&#8217;t think it saved us either, and we got combined with another group for another few months.  
Either way, this is probably the first PC game I had done since my initial messing around with C and databases when Borland C++ 4.5 came free with PC Plus! It&#8217;s definitely the first graphical game on the PC I had done up to this point.  
It&#8217;s here for historical blackmail purposes <img src="http://stuckiegamez.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

## Downloads

This game is very old, and was created in DIV Games Studio 2.  
As such, you&#8217;ll need either an old machine running DOS or Win9x.. or DosBox ( which I tested the game in, as seen in the screen shots. )  
[Death Karts Binary( 2mb 7zip )][4]

[Death Karts Source ( 1mb 7Zip)][5]

I don&#8217;t understand how the SOURCE could be smaller when there&#8217;s a 15mb FPG file in there, but whatever!

## Resources

I&#8217;ve replaced the music.. I don&#8217;t know what the original music was, as I couldn&#8217;t find it &#8211; and to be honest, I&#8217;m surprised I even found THIS in the first place!  
Music tracks are: Round The Twist, Can&#8217;t Stop Dancing and Still Dancing.. all by me.

## Project Status

Finished long long ago!  
I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll go back to this, to be honest&#8230; as I said, I&#8217;m surprised I even found it still, as I didn&#8217;t know of any copies that I had made!
