I have worked on a wide range of games &#8211; mostly in my spare time.

The menu on the left is organised in to Commercial, Homebrew, Ludum Dare and Archive &#8211; with projects being released under each category as and when they&#8217;re complete.

Commercial games generally being titles which have been completed under work conditions.  
Homebrew games being titles which I have created outside of normal working hours.  
Ludum Dare games being created for the excellent Ludum Dare 48hr Competition and 72hr Jam &#8211; <http://www.ludumdare.com>.  
And finally, the Archive is where all my older projects sit. As I feel it&#8217;s important for me to always remember where my roots have come from, and as I uncover more (usually horrific) projects that I&#8217;ve done in the past, I shall place them here for archival purposes.
