gameSPACE was meant to be built on top of siteENGiNE ( previously stuckiePORTAL and YaPP before that ) to enable grid-based games to be played online through a browser.

Originally known as The WebWar Engine due to being created for CHARGE!!! Web War, it was to grow into an engine for all sorts of turn-based games to be played via the browser.

With such recent technologies as webGL, HTML5, etc.. it&#8217;s pretty obsolete now.
