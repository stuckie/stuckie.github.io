      Griblade was created for the Main Playstation 2 Graphics Coursework in Second Year ( the first coursework was using ncurses with pad support &#8211; where Tiny Critters was born! )<br /> Originally, I was planning on doing Scavengers &#8211; a sort of first person game heavily based upon Games Workshop&#8217;s Space Hulk, but set in the CHARGE!!! universe, where you had to scavenge from derelict ships to keep yourself alive, and deal with any nasties that were on the ship.<br /> However, my raycaster ran slow as treacle, so that was scrapped and Griblade was born.<br /> Griblade was going to borrow heavily from Turrican and R-Type. The mass amount of sprite work needed for platformer sprites meant that for the coursework, I&#8217;d cut it down to a side-scrolling shooter.

      This is where the first instance of the SGameZ Engine was created &#8211; a multi-platform game engine and the proof is still in the code as it will compile and run on PS2Linux, PC and GP2X &#8211; in fact binaries for the GP2X and Windows are supplied, along with Makefiles and a CodeBlocks Project.<br /> <a href="/gamez/griblade/Griblade.7z">Griblade ( 8mb 7zip )</a>

      Due to it being a coursework that was done a long time ago, it has served it&#8217;s purpose, even though was LARGELY unfinished.<br /> That said, I&#8217;m hoping to go back to it and finish it off to the original design specs.
