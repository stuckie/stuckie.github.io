In this definition of Homebrew, these are full games which I&#8217;ve created outside of normal work by myself; and possibly with support from credited others.  
Specifically, these are complete games, that have not been done for competitions such as Ludum Dare.

It&#8217;s a bit empty just now, but I am working on the few titles you can see on the menu to the left.
