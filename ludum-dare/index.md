I try to regularly take part in Ludum Dare as time permits.

It&#8217;s not always easy, and recently I haven&#8217;t really been able to devote the full weekend to the projects that I&#8217;d like to do; however  I do try to release something which usually gets cobbled together in under a day&#8217;s worth of work.

Most end up in various stages of completeness, but there are a few good ideas lurking in there.

Source repository for all Ludum Dare entries now lives on GitHub: <https://github.com/stuckie/ludumdare>
