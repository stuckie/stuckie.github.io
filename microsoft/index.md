Hardware

2x Microsoft XBOX  
One soft-modded with XBMC and used nearly exclusively as a media player.  
One that hasn&#8217;t been fiddled with by my grubby mitts, yet.

3x Microsoft XBOX 360  
One Japanese  
One RROD  
One from eBay that had gotten banned ( thank you very much <img src="http://stuckiegamez.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> )
