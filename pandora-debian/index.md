Pandora Debian is a Debian based distribution for the Pandora hand held computer.

Originally being very heavy handed in how it was literally hacked together; with the next release I&#8217;m hoping to do things properly as well as host a Pandora-specific repository for Debian packages.

This repository will contain things such as libPND, Pandora specific settings and patched applications and libraries where necessary &#8211; in essence, the bare minimum to have Debian run on the Pandora and as fully functional as possible.
