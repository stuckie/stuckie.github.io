# PowerOUT

## Overview

PowerOUT was created for the WinAPI Coursework in Second Year.  
I created the entire thing from scratch in a weekend &#8211; hence the very horrid graphics &#8211; and was written on a Linux system using WINE to check the binary, and the mingw tool-chain to create the Win32 binary.

The goal of the game, is to power the reactors by feeding charge particles to a conversion station, and then wiring the station to the reactor. It borrows from Deflektor and Pipedream. It&#8217;s also made more difficult than it should be due to wires exploding, and a bug that made it very biased towards corners rather than straight pieces.  
There&#8217;s also some bugs in the path finding code, but the game in general works as a very quickly done prototype.

## Downloads

The download contains the Windows binary, which will run under WINE in Linux without problems, and *almost* full source code &#8211; the main.cpp file is missing. Unfortunately, I do not have this file any longer, so this is all the code I have.  
Also included is the Report that was submitted.

## Project Status

This was done for a WinAPI coursework and it met and succeeded with this goal.  
As for the game itself, there has been a second version worked on for a while &#8211; being rewritten in SDL to support other platforms.  
Chances are high that it will be redone and fixed.
