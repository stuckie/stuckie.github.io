On the sidebar to your left, there will be a context-sensitive menu that describes the various parent-child hierarchies of this site.

In other words, the Projects are split up into separate areas to make them easier to manage and find.  
However, with some of them as incomplete or dire as they are, I&#8217;m not wholly sure you&#8217;d want to find them!

Each main section has it&#8217;s own Index page, with a bit of blurb, and in some cases a time line of releases.  
The side menu will adjust accordingly as well.

Clicking the title of the section you&#8217;re in on the menu, will take you back up a level in the menu.  
And if the section you&#8217;re in has no child pages, it&#8217;ll just show the same menu so you can choose elsewhere.

If in doubt, click about!
