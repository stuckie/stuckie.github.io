# Santa&#8217;s Elves

## Overview

Santa&#8217;s Elves was created for the Computer Games Technology Flash coursework in First Year.  
I thought as it was coming up to Christmas, I would create a festive little game!  
It is basically a survival shooter&#8230; you control Santa at the bottom of the screen, and have to survive the onslaught of ever-increasing Elves from the top!
