SGZEngine was started in 2005 and was in use through to 2010.

Originally named SGameZEngine and being more a framework, it was used as the basis of several coursework projects through 2005 and 2006.

The engine then had a major overhaul in 2007 and 2008 as part of my Honours Project to add scriptable logic via use of Lua.  
In 2008, it received another overhaul in the addition of Horde3D, ODE and amBX support as part of Dare to be Digital for Plight of The Weedunks.  
In 2009, I tried to clean it up and re-release it as SGZ2D, but decided to keep to the SGZEngine moniker instead.  
It was then used for several Ludum Dare projects up till the end of 2010 when it was retired.
