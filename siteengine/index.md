﻿﻿siteENGiNE was the successor to stuckiePORTAL.  
It was meant to be run standalone as well as interface with forum systems easily to share user information.  
The engine was written in a mostly modular format so that extending it is fairly straight forward, to enable bridging it to any forum system quickly.  
While a lot of code is shared with stuckiePORTAL, siteENGiNE was to go beyond by adding in support for user-generated content such as Blogs, Profiles and Spaces.

It was however, in development hell.. only two sites ran it &#8211; the previous stuckieGAMEZ and MCRadio &#8211; and a great deal of work still needs to be done before any form of public release can be made&#8230; which isn&#8217;t likely to happen.  
For example, moving blocks around still requires manually setting them through a MySQL tool!

As such, MCRadio may even move to something else that&#8217;s actually maintainable, and siteENGiNE will be finally out of commission.
