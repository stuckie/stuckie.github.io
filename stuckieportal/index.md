stuckiePORTAL was a Portal front-end for SMF.  
It added page support, block support, and tied in to SMF&#8217;s member system for permissions and things, borrowing heavily from how YaPP was setup.

It was moderately successful and powered a few sites, and potentially still does.

The successor to this was siteENGiNE.

### Downloads

[stuckiePORTAL v3.0.2 ( 90k tar.gz )][1]  
This should still work on new SMF builds, I haven&#8217;t really checked.. the couple of sites that I know still use it have not had any problems when updating, however.. so I assume it&#8217;s still working!
