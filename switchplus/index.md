    Welcome to one of the fastest gaming experiences on Android and iOS. Switch sets you against obstacles and opponents as you weave your way through space and time. Your goal is to travel as far as possible while avoiding the energy beams that will destroy your ship. Time your switches correctly to also avoid the enemy ships. If you need some help, collect the shield power-ups that will let you smash through your opponents and achieve top scores.
