I collect games and hardware.

I have quite a fair amount of games and hardware in fact! Some rather rare bits and pieces in amongst it, and most consoles and computers I have are set up in some way or another for me to hack about on; nearly all of which I&#8217;ve written the eponymous Hello World on at the very least!

This section shall include pictures and stuff as appropriate.
